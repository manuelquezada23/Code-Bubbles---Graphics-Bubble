Code Bubbles Graphics Bubble.

This is still a work in progress.

The graphic bubble allows the user to graphically design their thoughts
on the screen. It is part of a bigger program called Code Bubbles, created
and designed by Professor Steven Reiss at Brown University. Here, the user 
is able to create rectangles, draw, input text boxes, paste and copy images, 
etc. All of these functionalities come with different colors, sizes, fonts, etc. 

The top right "?" button has some of the UI guidelines to understand some
of the functionalities that the bubble enables.
