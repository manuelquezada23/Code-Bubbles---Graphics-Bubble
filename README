The graphic bubble allows the user to graphically design their thoughts
on the screen. The user is able to create rectangles, draw, input text
boxes, paste and copy images, etc. All of these functionalities come
with different colors, sizes, fonts, etc. 

The top right "?" button has some of the UI guidelines to understand some
of the functionalities that the bubble enables.
